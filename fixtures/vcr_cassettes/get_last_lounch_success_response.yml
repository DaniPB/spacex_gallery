        are expected to be version 1.0, from SLC-40, Cape Canaveral AFS. It is the
        ninth Starlink launch overall. The satellites will be delivered to low Earth
        orbit and will spend a few weeks maneuvering to their operational altitude
        of 550 km. This mission is expected to include rideshare payloads, SkySats
        16-18, on top of the Starlink stack. The booster for this mission is expected
        to land an ASDS.","upcoming":false,"static_fire_date_utc":null,"static_fire_date_unix":null,"timeline":null,"crew":null,"last_date_update":"2020-06-11T04:25:39.000Z","last_ll_launch_date":null,"last_ll_update":null,"last_wiki_launch_date":"2020-06-13T09:21:00.000Z","last_wiki_revision":"9a320975-ab9b-11ea-8445-0e30d54c90e7","last_wiki_update":"2020-06-11T04:25:39.000Z","launch_date_source":"wiki"}'
